1.	Automation Tool ‚Äì Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
2.	Agentless ‚Äì It does not require any agent to be installed on managed nodes; it uses SSH (Linux) and WinRM (Windows) for communication.
3.	Uses YAML (Playbooks) ‚Äì Ansible uses simple YAML files called Playbooks to define automation tasks in a human-readable format.
4.	Push-based Configuration ‚Äì By default, Ansible follows a push-based model, where commands are executed directly from the control node to target machines.
5.	Idempotency ‚Äì Ansible ensures that tasks are executed only if changes are required, preventing unnecessary modifications.
6.	Masterless Architecture ‚Äì Unlike Puppet and Chef, Ansible does not require a dedicated master server; a control node is sufficient.
7.	Highly Scalable ‚Äì It can manage thousands of nodes from a single control machine without complex infrastructure requirements.
8.	Modules & Plugins ‚Äì Ansible provides a vast collection of modules to manage different OS, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), network devices, and more.
9.	Cross-Platform ‚Äì Supports multiple operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, and network devices.
10.	Security Focused ‚Äì Uses OpenSSH for secure communication and does not store sensitive data on managed nodes.
11.	Extensive Community & Enterprise Support ‚Äì Offers community support and an enterprise version called Ansible Automation Platform (formerly Ansible Tower/AWX).
12.	Declarative & Procedural ‚Äì Ansible allows both declarative (state-based) and imperative (task-based) automation.
13.	Integrations ‚Äì Works well with Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions), cloud services, and more.
14.	Event-Driven Automation ‚Äì Can integrate with tools like Event-Driven Ansible to automate responses to system changes or alerts.
15.	Low Learning Curve ‚Äì Easier to learn compared to Puppet and Chef due to its simple syntax and no need for scripting knowledge.
